# Getting Started

## Core Concepts

Imagine a world where

* you can choose a self-contained peice of code
* and you can utilize the available compute/storage resources on the Internet

to run the code anywhere at the push of a button. Where you can remotely control the code that is running on mobile devices in people pockets, on people Desktops/Laptops running in their homes, on servers running in a factory building. And you can do it all with the same technology. A world where people on the Internet can rent their computers and mobile devices to people or companies who do not have enough in-house resources and currently paying a lot to the cloud service providers to have compute/storage resources. A world where there is no single point of failure and no centralized authority controls how your software is deployed. Decentralized/Edge Cloud main purpose is to enable you do all these in a secure and highly resilient way.

## Decentralized/Edge Cloud

Our main goal is to enable people on the Internet who are willing to rent their available compute/storage resources to companies or people who need these resources to run their day to day business which currently doing that by either having local data-centre or paying cloud providers like AWS or Azure to provide them these type of resources.

Decentralized/Edge Cloud can also help IoT platform providers to utilize the resources available in a nearest region to process and store the data generated on the edge in a much cheaper and resilient way.

## Use Cases of Decentralized/Edge Cloud

An example use case for the Decentralized/Edge Cloud would be for startup/middle size software companies that require VMs to build and test their product or storage to store their software artifacts. A typical software company runs some sort of CI/CD (ex. Jenkins) either on the cloud or locally on their servers and store their produced artifacts on AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage or some kind of artifactory. These companies either buy hardware and hire engineers to support their infrastructure to ensure their infrastructure is always up and running and their produced contents are always available to the consumer. Their other choice is to setup the same environment on the cloud and pay cloud service provider to provide same type of services.

The above mentioned requirement is usually expensive to run, support and maintain regardless of running them locally or on the cloud. This is while company staffs' hardware are idle most of time or worst case scenario a developer is running a local software build. The staffs themselves or the company support team is already taking care of their hardware health and make sure it is patched with latest software and it is always up and running.

The Decentralized/Edge Cloud enables companies to use their in-house available resources for their software product build/test requirements and provide them storage by distributing the contents evenly on companies available Desktops./Laptops as well as staff work mobile phones. Due to the decentralized design principle in Decentralized/Edge Cloud, the platform can reach out to available and closest resources on the Internet that are physically cheaper to upload the content to or to run software processes on when not enough resources are available within the company's resource at any point of time.

## Introducing Decentralized/Edge Cloud

Decentralized/Edge Cloud is a decentralized edge computing/storage platform powered by the people on the Internet who are willing to rent their availale computing power and storage. It aims to make developing edge software just like developing for the cloud. Distributed IoT applications let you put your code at the edge and keep data anywhere you want. Decentralized/Edge Cloud enables you to use cheaper resources instead of dedicating hardware to run the same services and applications on the edge.
